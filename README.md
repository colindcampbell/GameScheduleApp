This is a full restful RoR CRUD league scheduling app. 

For the data storage I used MongoDB and paired that with embeded ruby on the front end. The site is fully mobile respnsive using Bootstrap 3. I wrote custom authentication using bcrypt, but also made the league show page accessible in a read-only format.
